# MATH2400-Lecture-Notes
My MATH2400 Lecture Notes (so far) and LaTeX Code/Macros to go with them.

They may be a week or so behind at any given time, or lacking examples/figures. Those will be added over time, but won't be added initially. 

Note that for the Figures to load correctly, you need to have set up Inkscape to work with LaTeX:
  1. The LaTeX command exectuable needs to run with the argument --shell-escape
  2. The directory for Inkscape and LaTeX need to be added to your $PATH

A pretty good guide for both of these steps can be found at https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/2099/how-to-include-svg-diagrams-in-latex/523685#523685

My macros .sty file, EliMacros.sty, as well as the Figures folder will need to be in the same directory that you run the .tex file to compile correctly.
